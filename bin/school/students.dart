// # IMPORT SPECIFIC PROPERTY

// If we have many variables in the file which we want to import and we only need some variable to import.

var sagar = 100;
var kita = 200;
var sujay = 300;

disp1() {
  print("Disp1");
}

disp2() {
  print("Disp2");
}


// now all this variables and functions we dont want to use in main.dart file.
// We only want to use "Sagar" variable and "disp1" function
// if we import this file - all the file properties will get imported, but we dont want that
// we want to import specific properties
// for that use "show" keyword in main.dart file
