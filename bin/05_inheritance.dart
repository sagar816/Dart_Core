// # INHERITANCE

//Dart does not have multiple inheritance - but can be achieved using "implements"

// Deriving a new class from old class, which will have all the features(properties/class members) of old class along with new features of the new class that we will put.
// example - Father's all property is inherited by son/daughter

// ## SINGLE INHERITANCE 
// One Father - One Son
// Super Class - Sub Class
// Parent Class - Child Class
